# Twitter Scrapper

Built a Scrapper (Python + Jupyter) that:<br/>
•Takes an input (keyword) searches the latest tweets that contains that keyword (can accept #)<br/>
•Will run the code as long as the user want's to or there are no more updates on that particular subject (keyword)<br/>
•Will copy the results as CSV in a specific path (chosen by user)<br/>
•Will remove any unwanted information in the columns<br/>


•When you initialize the notebook, it will ask the user for input(Keyword):

•After typing the input (marketing in this case) it will start scrapping data from the latest tweets:
